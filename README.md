What is Machine Learning: The ability of computer to learn from data with the use of algorithms, without the programer telling the computer what excatly to do(explicit programming)

TYPES OF ML: Supervised- The input will have corresponding output labels, Training the models to learn the output.
Unspuervised-Unlabled data to learn the patterns in the data.
Reinforcement learning- Agent(computer) learning in environment based rewards and penalties.

Qualitative Data: Categorical data, eg: gender, different countires. This is nominal data which means the no inherit order( we can't say USA is 1, India is 2), To feed it into our computer we can use one hot encoding. What is one hot encoding: Converting a nominal data to computer understanding data(numbers), if it matches a category make it a 1 or else make it 0 for eg:(male 0, female 1). There is also ordinal data which inherit values for example ratings from 1-5

Quntitaive data: Numerical data, which can be continuoues or discret. 

SUPERVISED LEARNING:

1: Classification- predict discret classes( wheather it is a hot dog or pizza or burger) this is also multiclass classification. Binary classficiation is predicting whether it is hotdog or not. 

2: Regression- Predict countiounes values like price of stock, temperature of tomorrow.

METRICS OF PERFORMENCE:

LOSS- Diffrence between predicited value and actual values

ACCURACY-THe actaul % of values model got right.
